# Shop Management System

## Introduction
This is a simple Shop Management System implemented in Java. It allows users to manage a list of products, including adding, displaying, deleting, searching for products, calculating the total price, and saving records to a file. The system supports three types of products: Electronics, Clothing, and Books, each with specific attributes.

## How It Works
- Users can choose from a menu of options to interact with the system.
- They can add products of different types (Electronics, Clothing, or Books) with specific details such as name, price, quantity, and type-specific attributes (brand, size, author).
- Users can display the list of products in the shop.
- Products can be deleted by entering their name.
- Users can search for products by name and see if they exist in the shop.
- The system calculates the total price of all products in the shop.
- Users can save the product records to a text file.
